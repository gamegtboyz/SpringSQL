This is the initial upload of this projects, so I need to berifly describe what I have done on this project.
#1 Create the SQL database.
  I created this database using mySQL, the projects illustrated the coffeshop named 'the_mad_coffee' with various products and branches. Then create user named james and give the super-user authorization to him.
  
#2 Build the Projects using Spring Boot
  Then create maven project. Currently, I use 3 dependencies as follows;  spring-boot-starter-web (released version from org.springframework.boot), 
                                                                          spring-boot-starter-java-jdbc (released version from oeg.springframework.boot),
                                                                          mysql-connector-java(released version from mysql).
